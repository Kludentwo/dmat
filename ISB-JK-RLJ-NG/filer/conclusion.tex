\chapter{Conclusion}
We can conclude on a successful first development iteration of our project. Throughout the project we have developed in matlab and implemented on the blackfin.

We implemented the system on a blackfin board with a speaker outputting the result of our distance measurement. The distance measurement was done using a speaker and a microphone.

We can conclude on a project with an acceptable system as results. We managed to measure the full range of our requirement although the precision was not within the first specification. The speed of the system was acceptable although it could be improved by rewriting our software in assembly language. 

We are happy to conclude this project with a working product.
