\chapter{Abstract}
This report by three sixth semester electronic engineering students at Aarhus School of Engineering,  Aarhus University presents an explanation of the groups project: "Distance Measurement using Audio".  The purpose of this  project is to develop and implement a system using embedded digital signal processing. The project has been split to 4 phases covering specification, development, implementation and test.\\
The group has written a project development document entitling the implementation of system measuring distance using audio signals. The system will send out an audible sound signal, record it and cross correlate it with the original signal. A sound is played based on the distance measured.\\
The project has resulted in a fully  functional system with room for improvement. These improvements have been described in the report as well.\\
The group has gained knowledge in the field of embedded signal processing and signal processing in general.
