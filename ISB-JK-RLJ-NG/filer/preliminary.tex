\chapter{Preliminary}
This report is written by three 6th semester electrical engineering students at Aarhus school of Engineering. The students have no prior experiences with acoustic signals, \textit{embedded} signal processing nor the blackfin. This report should be read as the result of a preliminary technological research for a system as described in the \textit{System Description}

The process has been divided into four main phases:
\begin{itemize}
\item System specifications
\item Algorithm development
\item Algorithm implementation
\item System Test
\end{itemize}

These phases form the main structure of this report with the purpose of guiding the reader through our process. In addition to the four phases we have included \textit{Analysis} where we describe some of our initial thoughts on how to handle the distance measurement. We also have our \textit{Results}, \textit{Obtained experiences} and finally our \textit{Conclusion}.
