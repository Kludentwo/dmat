\textbf{\HUGE Digital distanceinstrument}\\

\subsection{Idea}
The scope of the project is to develop and implement an instrument using distance sensors to a DSP playing different amplitudes, frequencies or tones depending on the distance to a hand.
\subsection{System overview:}
Below is shown a sketch of the system using simple blocks.

\subsection{System description:}
The system should measure distance using audio. There needs to be a transmitter and a receiver.\\
It should output the distance as a function of either frequency output or LED indication.\\
The system needs to be real-time and measurement and output should be continuous.\\
The user uses his/her hand to place it over the transmitter and receiver to indicate some kind of distance.\\


\section{Requirements}
%De requirements vi har (fra opgave specifikationen)
Below is shown the requrements the group made to the project. These requrements have been subject to change during the project, mostly because some of them weren't as relevant as the group initially thought.
\begin{itemize}
\item Use of DSP
\item Sound output
\item Sound input
\item Precision <5cm
\item Range 10cm-250cm
\item Frequency band: 10kHz-15kHz
\item Sample rate: 48kHz
\item Memory: 1MB
\item System must be real-time
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Changes to requrements:}\\
The range has been changed to: 25cm-250cm.\\
Frequency band has been changed to: 14kHz-16kHz\\
Memory has been changed to: 32kB\\
