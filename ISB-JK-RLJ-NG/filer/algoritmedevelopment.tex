\begin{enumerate}
\item X-corr
\item DMA:\\
The is a controller circuit on embedded units that can initiate memory read or write cycles. Before the DMA controller can be used we have to initiate it. This is largely platform specific and the way we do it on the blackfin will be described in the algorith implementation chapter. The DMA controller on the blackfin can move data between L1 Cache, Flash or SDRAM and units connected to the DMA Access Bus. The Scope of our project means that we have to use Sport0 (which will be connected to the audio connectors) and internal memory from the L1.
